# Chess

### A simple 2-player chess engine on python console

Instructions:
- Enter moves in the following format (examples):
- - d2d4 #pawn on d2 moves to d4
- - b2c4 #pawn on b2 attempts to move to c4, this will fail and the script will bounce it back
- - e1g1 #king side castle - this will succeed if the rook is on h1 and nothing is in the way

- A player wins when the opposing king is no longer on the board (you will need to actually capture the king)

Have fun!
